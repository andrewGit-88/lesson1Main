//MODULE 6:
//Lesson 2:     Classes and Objects:

//    Object Oriented Programming ----> Classes and Objects
//    Create Class (ex. Vegetable) ----> Objects (ex. Potato, Cucumber, Tomato)
//    Create Class (ex. Car) ----> Objects (ex. Honda, Volkswagen, BMW)
//          Integers and Variable could be a part of CLASS now instead of belonging to methods only
//          public class Car{
//              String Model;
//              int year;
//              String number;
//          }
//          public void drive(){
//              System.out.println("go!")
//          }
//            public void stop(){
//                System.out.println("stop!");
//            }
//
//
//MODULE 6:
//Lesson 3:     Classes and Objects Demo:
//    follow next package PAGES class in this module
//    creating an accessible String or Int for every class, (Page - for writing methods to test with (ex. openPage/closePage/clickButton))
//    creating a class with methods testing, (PageMain for Testing the Page - then creating a new Page method testing, assigning String and Integer Values)

//MODULE 6:
//Lesson 4:     Class Constructors:
//      Method that we can create in class (public method - has to be called exactly as class name (same name)
//      you also have to fill it with information when creating new object)

//MODULE 6:
//Lesson 5:     Encapsulation and Modifiers:

//        Class:
//        putting Public (modifier) - to the main attribute
//                Default (no modifier) - the class is only accessible by classes in the same package

//        Method/Attribute/Constructor
//        putting Public - accessible by any  other class (get / set)
//                Private - only accessible within declared class (for get and set)
//                Protected - The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses (encapsulation)
// }
//MODULE 6:
//Lesson 6:     Inheritance:
//                Login Page Class see EXAMPLE;
//MODULE 6:
//Lesson 7:     Polymorphism:
//                Transformation method Parent Class / Child Class;
//                Function that will return the name of the developer worker that works on the page
//                The structure of building CODE will use EXTENDS to link the methods to main class

//MODULE 6:
//Lesson 8:     Abstraction:
//                Abstract Class; you cannot create an object, cannot use CONSTRUCTOR but you can inherit use EXTEND
//                could contain abstract methods, public abstract getDeveloperName() , in superclass change from POLYMORPHISM to "normal" INHERITANCE
//                   after youcan use normal get and set functions to the rest of the main class loginpage.setid(1) ,
//                  another way to establish a secure code in case when you know object we inherit cannot work
//                  as a normal obect we can enclose it an only inherit and not create! object will always have basic characteristics
//                  by creating an abstract void means you replicate, but next class that has EXTENDS to it you HAVE to make sure you describe the object
//                  An Abstract Class can have non-abstract methods and interface not
//                  An Abstract Class provide default methods implementation and Interface not
//                  To Use interface Class should have "Implements" ket and for AbstractClass - "Extends"
//Lesson 9:     Interface:
//                Cannot be initiated
//                Cannot be inherited
//                Can contain abstract methods only
//                Can be implemented
//                Several interfaced coulb be implemented by one class (inheritance only)
//                INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
//MODULE 6:
//Lesson 10:
//              Classes and Object: Attributes and Methods, and object that will be created
//              Constructors: Helps create objects, Has to have a name of class, attributes of CLass
//              Encapsulation: Close the code to ENCAPSULATE - PRIVATE blocking access____.> Get and Set Functions ---to hide and secure methods
//              Inheritance: Crete parent/child class, GROUP Class, Superclss , create functionality use the same code repeating
//              Polymorphism: Object too turn into different forms shape it
//              Abstractions: Encloses details of code, shows only name - Hides the object but doesnt show the solution to it - cannot inherit
//              Interface: the most strict type of abstraction, cannot create constructor you can only IMPLEMENT

//MODULE 6:
//Lesson 12:
//        Homework solution Demo - Hiarchy
//        -LUCIDCHART101 - www.lucidchart.com
//        -SCHEME create analysis of creating full scale project start up through describing each action and method as well as attributes
//        -Create the parameters of a diagram, to desscribe classes and types
//        -Use of UML Class diagram
