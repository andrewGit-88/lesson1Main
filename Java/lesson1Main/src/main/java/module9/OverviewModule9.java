//Module9: Git and Github
//      Lesson1 INTRO:

//Module9:
//      Lesson2:
//              Version Control (VCS):
//                                  Collaborative development
//                                  Keep records of changes
//                                  Who changed,when and why
//                                  Revert Changes
//              Version control helps multiple people working on the same project,
//                      remote access saves server

//Module9:
//      Lesson3:
//              GIT Main Functionality:
//                      One of the Version Control Systems
//                      Keeps entire code and history
//                      Allows push and pull from remote server
//                      Most popular tool today
//              Git repository:
//                      The place all your (shared) code is saved
//                      to get code from remote use command: git clone
//                      Could be done with IntelliJ Idea UI
//              Repository splits into BRANCHES:
//                      Git has a tree hierarchy
//                      The main (common) branch is usually called master branch
//                      Each team member works on his/her own branch
//                      Its possible to push/pull from branch
//                      Master branch is usually limited to pull only (so someone else can check code before push)
//              Commit and Merge:
//                      Commit - the act of creating snapshot (GIT COMMIT (includes message why change is made))
//                      Part of Branch
//                      Push command - push your local changes to remote repository
//                      Pull request - request to combine your code with the master (usually)
//                      Merge - combine your code with all the other changes in the branch
//
//Module9:
//      Lesson4:
//              Example of team work:
//                      -First the teammembers clones master branch
//                      -They create their own branches (MaryBranch/JohnBranch)
//                      -Once they finish their code (possibly once a week) they commit and push
//                      -Pull request is issued after for CODE REVIEW
//                      -Once Pull Request approved merged to master branch
//                      -Pull origin Master final
//                      -Both teammates synchronize their code with commit,push

//Module9:
//      Lesson5:
//              GITHUB Ignore File:
//                  create file in Lesson1Main (.gitignore)
//                          inside file - type:
//                                  .idea/
//                                  *.iml
